# Hi there 👋, I'm Dev!

I am a React developer with 2 years of experience in making complex web applications. I am good at Next JS, React, and MongoDB. I love designing user interfaces that are responsive and can grow while still being fast and efficient. I understand modern front-end development ideas and practices well, including ES6+, TypeScript, CSS preprocessors, and testing tools like Jest and Enzyme. I pay attention to details and like solving problems. I want to write good code and create great user experiences. I care about keeping up with new web development trends and contributing back to the React community by working on open-source projects.

### 🌱 What I'm Learning
